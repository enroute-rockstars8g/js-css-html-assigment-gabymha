        <div class="title">ABOUT ME</div>

        <div class="p1">My name is Gabriela Hinojosa and i'm an industrial designer. All my family and i are from Monterrey, Nuevo León, but because of my dad's job we moved a few times while i was young, having the chance to live in different cities like Aguascalientes, León and Saltillo.
        <div class="p2">When i was 16 years old, i had the chance to study one year of High School in Mississippi. It was a new experience, a little terrifying but really helped me to improve my social and english skills. I ended up loving it and made a few good friends. When i came back i started college, i chose Industrial Design because it included the things that i most liked that were designing, drawing and building.</div>
        <div class="p3">During college i worked in a Manufacturing Company and in a Marketing Agency, i learned about 3D modeling, graphic desinging and dealing with clients. When i graduated, i had the opportunity to work as a nanny in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was a tought decision to go and live with a strange family while keeping my remote job in Mexico. It was exhausting but it was worth it. Seriously, one of the bext experiences of my life. I met incredible people who changed my perspective of life, i improved my english, i traveled and lost the fear to get out of my confort zone and of course, saved a little bit of money. </div>
        <div class="p4">I decided to get into the Rockstars program because i want to learn more and get better. When i started working in marketing i realized that i loved it and i'm good at it, but i needed more. I had to learn how to build websites, UX and learn the design from the bottom of technology.</div>
